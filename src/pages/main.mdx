title: Human Skin Detection in Color Images
description: Skin detection is the process of discriminating skin and non-skin pixels in an arbitrary image and represents an intermediate step in several image processing tasks, such as facial analysis and biomedical segmentation. Different approaches have been presented in the literature, but a comparison is diffcult to perform due to multiple datasets and varying performance measurements. In this work, the datasets and the state-of-the-art approaches are reviewed and categorized using a new proposed taxonomy. Three different representative skin detector methods of the state of the art are selected and thoroughly analyzed. This approaches are then evaluated on three different state of the art datasets and skin tones sub-datasets using multiple metrics. The evaluation is performed on single and cross dataset scenario to highlight key differences between methods, reporting also the inference time. Finally, the results are organized into multiple tables, using the related figures as an assistance tool to support the discussion. Experimental results demonstrate the strength and weaknesses of each approach, and the need to involve multiple metrics for a fair assessment of the method’s aspects.

Skin detection is the process of <b>discriminating skin and non-skin pixels</b>. It is
quite a challenging process because of the large color diversity that objects and
human skin can assume, and scene properties such as lighting and background.

  ## Taxonomy

  <p>
  Skin detection is a <b>binary classification problem</b>: the pixels of an image must be divided between skin and non-skin classes.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of several ways to categorize methods is to group them according to how the pixel classification is done.
  </p>

    <Taxonomy />

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--8 col--offset-2">
      <div id="taxonomy-thresholding" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Thresholding</b> approaches use <em>plain rules</em> to classify each pixel as either skin or non-skin. An example is the following.<br />
        A given (Y,Cb,Cr) pixel is a skin pixel if 133&lt;=Cr&lt;=173 and 77&lt;=Cb&lt;=127
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxonomy-fuzzylogic" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Fuzzy logic</b> approaches use a <em>set of rules</em> to calculate a combined truth value between 0 and 1. The truth value drives the classification. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxonomy-deeplearning" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Deep learning</b> approaches use training data to create a <em>neural network model</em> which is then used to perform classification.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxonomy-statistical" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Statistical</b> approaches use training data to create a <em>statistical model</em> which is then used alongside probability calculus to perform classification.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxonomy-ensemble" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Ensemble</b> approaches use the classifications from different <em>independent</em> machine learning <em>models</em> trained on the same data as votes for determining the best
        classification.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="taxonomy-hybrid" class="hide" >
        <p>
        <b>Hybrid</b> approaches make use of different classification techniques that <em>work together</em> to perform the final classification.

  ## Methods Selection

  <p>
  <em>Thresholding</em>, <em>Statistical</em>, and <em>Deep Learning</em> have been the chosen approaches.<br />
  The first to demonstrate whether <em>simple rules</em> can achieve powerful results; and the latter two to compare how differently the models behave and generalize, and whether the capabilities of a CNN to <em>extract semantic features</em> can give an advantage.

  <p>
  The skin pixels clusters assume a trapezoidal shape in the YCb and YCr color subspaces. Moreover, the shape and size of the trapezium vary according to many factors, such as the illumination conditions. In high illumination conditions, the base of the trapezium results larger.
  </p>
  <p>
  Besides, the chrominance components of a skin pixel P with coordinates (P<sub>Y</sub>, P<sub>Cb</sub>, P<sub>Cr</sub>) in the YCbCr space exhibit the following behavior: the further is the (P<sub>Y</sub>, P<sub>Cr</sub>) point from the longer base of the trapezium in the YCr subspace, the further is the (P<sub>Y</sub>, P<sub>Cb</sub>) point from the longer base of the trapezium in the YCb subspace, and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
  The aforementioned observations are the base of the method: it tries to define image-specific trapeziums in the YCb and YCr color subspaces and then verifies that the correlation rules between the two subspaces reflect the inversely proportional behavior of the chrominance components.

  An additional deep level is appended to the original U-Net model, to better capture large-scale contextual features in the deepest part of the network.
  The features extracted in the contracting path propagate to the corresponding expansive levels through the dense blocks.

  <p>
  The original U-Net convolutional layers are replaced with the inception modules: before each max-pooling layer, in the contracting path, and after concatenating features, in the expanding path.
  Thanks to these architectural choices, Skinny benefits from a wider pixel context.

  ## Results

  <p>
  <em>Thresholding</em>, <em>Statistical</em>, and <em>Deep Learning</em> have been the chosen approaches.<br />
  The first to demonstrate whether <em>simple rules</em> can achieve powerful results; and the latter two to compare how differently the models behave and generalize, and whether the capabilities of a CNN to <em>extract semantic features</em> can give an advantage.
